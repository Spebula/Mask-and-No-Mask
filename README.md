# Mask Detection Project

This project is designed to detect if a person is wearing a mask or not using a camera and a trained model.

## The Algorithm

How it works: The model is trained on images you provide, with each image labeled as "mask" or "no mask". 

Ensure you have the libraries installed in order to run this. 

## Running this project

1. For this project, you'll need a webcam connected to your NVIDIA Jetson nano device. Once you have your data, you can train and test the model. 
2. PyTorch and OpenCV
